# ðŸ§  Sprint 0 â€“ Core Setup | quiz_engine_pro

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Establish the foundational backend structure for the `quiz_engine_pro` module. This includes core models (`quiz.quiz`, `quiz.question`, `quiz.answer`), admin views, and a basic menu system. No quiz logic, frontend UI, or evaluation flow is implemented in this sprint.
